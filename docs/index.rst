Welcome to kuma-py's documentation!
===================================

This is the documentation for kuma-py, a Python wrapper, for the Kuma
software —built by Mozilla— that empowers also the Mozilla Developer Network.
kuma-py lets you easily traverse the Mozilla Developer Network (and any other
kuma-powered website), thus it serves as a gateway to access knowledge and
make the world better.
